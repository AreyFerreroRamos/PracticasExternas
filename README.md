# Description: This script calculates the alpha diversity of the wild and captivity individuals from vertebrate species from
#        those used in the study.
#   Parameters:
#       -A first file that contains a table with the number of species per genus in every individual of that vertebrate species
#        used in that study.
#       -A second file with the metadata of all the samples in the study. We need it for telling wild from captive individuals.
#       -A third file with the scientific name that corresponds to the code that identifies a vertebrate species.
#   Output:
#       -The alpha diversity of the wild individuals in all vertebrate species.
#       -The alpha diversity of the captive individuals in all vertebrate species.
#       -A boxplot that shows the distribution of alpha diversities in both wild and captive individuals in all vertebrate species.
